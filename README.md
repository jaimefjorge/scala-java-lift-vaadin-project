Lift/Vaadin using scala/java
====================

What Is It?
---------------------
This is a mixed Lift/Vaadin project with intention of using lift's DataMapper, that allows easy/cheap object persistency in a given project, and Vaadin to have nice UIs.
This is also java/scala mixed to use lift (in scala) and Vaadin (in java).

Requirements
---------------------
You should have SBT installed.

Deployment
---------------------
Also you should make sure that web.xml is (after compilation and deployment) in the right folder (default is <project-name>/target/scala***/webapps/WEB-INF/

Feedback
---------------------
